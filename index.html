<h2><span>
    What is general contracting?
</span></h2>
<p>
    This service offered by B.A.K. Construction lends general contractors to oversee and execute the construction of a variety of projects.
    These projects can range from the renovation and construction of homes to building small businesses and ventures from the ground up.
</p>
<p>
    General contractors enter a contract with the property's owner, separate from the architect or designer contract.
    General contractors and may also manage and hire subcontractors to aid in the labor-intensive construction procedures of the project.
    They manage vendors and are responsible for communication and coordination between all parties involved.
</p>

<h2><span>
    What is construction management?
</span></h2>
<p>
    Construction management, comparatively, is a different utility offered by B.A.K that is typically focused on larger projects, but not neccessarily.
    This service's main goal is to provide a project manager who acts as an <em>owner's representative</em> for the property owner or manager.
</p>
<p>
    An owner's representative essentially takes care of the property's renovation or construcrion in place of the owner. 
    Similar to a general contractor, they also manage and hire subcontractors for the labor required for the project, but their responsibilities extend beyond.
    Their tasks often include, but are not limited to, selecting project sites, ensuring proper licensing and permits for the project, overseeing safety, choosing 
    architectural and design choices, in addition to all facets of the actual construction.
</p>

<h2><span>
    What service is best for you?
</span></h2>
<p>
    If you are a property owner or project manager, it may be difficult in choosing exactly which one of B.A.K Construction's service is the best for you.
    Ask yourself the important question: are you looking for a hands-off approach to the project in question or do you want to submit your input and advice every step of the way?
</p>

<p>
    If you selected the former, consider construction management. Not only is every step of the construction managed on your behalf, but if you feel ill-prepared 
    to handle any architectural or legal issues, the owner's representative will be reliable in handling those essential steps for you. Given any limits in resources, 
    owner's representatives have the special ability to decide on appropriate and wise budgeting allocation based on years of their experience in the industry.
</p>
<p>
    On the other hand, if you would like to input more of your suggestions along the way, considering just hiring general contracting assistance. 
    Contractors are responsible for most of the logistics behind the construction of the project, but they ptherwise follow your jurisidiction and judgment on other important aspects
    of the project, such as design, expenses, location and licensing. You are able to have much more flexibility according to your vision for the project.
